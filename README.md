Orange Language
===============

Overview
--------

Orange language is a simple toy programming language written by Java. 

I do this as a experiment when reading the book  [《两周自制脚本语言》](http://book.douban.com/subject/25908672/), ectually Orange language is almost a copy of Stone language which is the example of this book.

Anyhow, it's just a toy language made by a new learner who is interseted in language design and compiler theory. It has little features and has many functions to be done. I will complete it little by little.

Features
--------

* Basic arithmetic operations
* Variables without types
* Conditional & Looping statements
* Working on JVM

TODOs
-----

* Fuctions
* Basic Object-Oriented features
* A compiler rather than interpreter
